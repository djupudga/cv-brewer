cv-brewer
=========

Brew different versions of your CV. Output is pdf.

Write config files which determine the contents of your CV. Write
multiple versions of your different job descriptions. Use the
config file to pick and choose your CV contents.

All data files, including config, should be written in YAML.

Very un-opinionated app. Depends on wkhtmltopdf so you need to install it.
